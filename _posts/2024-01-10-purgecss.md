[PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) is a very nifty tool remove unused CSS from a project before it is shipped.

A simple example
-----

Take a look at the following [web page](/static/purgecss/before/).

It is a simple page with some centered content.

If you look at its [associated css](/static/purgecss/before/style.css), you will notice that there are two CSS rules, _one of which is not used anywhere_:

    .container {
      display: flex;
      min-height: 100vh;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }

    /** This rule is not used, why are we shipping it? */
    .not-used {
      color: red;
    }

We really shouldn't have the end user download 26 bytes of unused CSS, it makes our site slower, and serves no purpose.

Getting rid of pu

    purgecss --css *.css --content *.html --output .
