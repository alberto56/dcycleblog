Getting around "Replace NewToner" on Dell E310DW

<img src="/assets/img/dell.png" alt="Dell E310DW" />

The Dell E310DW prevents you from printing if it thinks the toner is low. Of course, the toner is fine, it's just planned obsolescence.

There is a way around this:

* Go to http://dellfa608a.local./general/replacetoner.html
* In the Replace Toner section, select "Continue", then "Submit".

(Make sure there are no pending jobs, because you'll get the error message "Make sure no one else is using the printer".)
