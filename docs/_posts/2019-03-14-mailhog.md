Often, during local Drupal development (or if we're really unlucky, in production), we get the dreaded message, "Unable to send e-mail. Contact the site administrator if the problem persists."

This can make it hard to debug anything email-related during local development.

Enter Mailhog
-----

[Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) is a dummy SMTP server with a browser GUI, which means you view all outgoing messages with a Gmail-type interface.

It is a major pain to install, but we can automate the entire process with the magic of Docker.

Let's see how it works, and discuss after. Follow along by installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) -- **no other dependencies are required** -- and installing [a Drupal 8 starterkit](http://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site):

    git clone https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site.git
    cd starterkit-drupal8site
    ./scripts/deploy.sh

This will install the following Docker containers: a MySQL server with a starter database, a configured Drupal site, and Mailhog. You wil see something like this at the end of the output:

    If all went well you can now access your site at:

    => Drupal: http://0.0.0.0:32791/user/reset/...
    => Dummy email client: http://0.0.0.0:32790

**You might be seeing different port numbers instead of 32791 and 32790, so use your own instead of the example ports.**

Now, the magic
-----

* Visit http://0.0.0.0:DRUPAL_PORT/user/password
* Enter "admin" and submit
* Now visit http://0.0.0.0:MAILHOG_PORT

(In my example, DRUPAL_PORT is 32791 and MAILHOG_PORT is 32790. In your case it will probably be different.)

As you can see, all emails produced by Drupal are now visible on a cool GUI!

So how does it work?
-----

A dedicated "Mailhog" docker container, using on the [Mailhog Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/) is defined in [our docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L5-L9). It exposes port 8025 for public GUI access, which is mapped to a random unused port on the host computer (in the above example, 32790). Port 1025 is the SMTP mailhog port [as you can see in the Mailhog Dockerfile](https://hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/Dockerfile). We are not mapping port 1025 to a random port on the host computer because it's only needed in the Drupal container, not the host machine.

In the same docker-compose.yml, the "drupal" container (service) [defines a link to the "mail" service](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L33); this means that when you are inside the Drupal container, you can access Mailhog SMPT server "mail" at port 1025.

In the Starterkit's [Dockerfile](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/Dockerfile#L59), we download the [SMTP](https://www.drupal.org/project/smtp) modules, and in [our configuration](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/drupal/config/core.extension.yml#L36), we install SMTP (0, in this case, is the module's weight, it doesn't mean "disabled"!).

Next, configuration: because this is for local development, [we are leaving SMTP off in the exported configuration](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/drupal/config/smtp.settings.yml#L1); in production we don't want SMTP to link to Mailhog. Then, in [our overridden settings](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/drupal/settings/local-settings.php#L22-L31), we enable SMTP and set the server to "mail" and the port to 1025.

Now, you can debug sent emails in a very realistic way!

You can remove the starterkit environment by running:

    docker-compose down -v
