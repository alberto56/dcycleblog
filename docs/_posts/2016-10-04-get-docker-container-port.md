Generally I like to map my Docker containers to dynamic ports to avoid port collisions, so I'll build my containers like this:

    docker run --name some-container-name -d -p 80 some-image

Here, Docker will find a free port and map it to port 80 on the container.

Although not foolproof, the following code will tell you what that port is:

    PORT="$(docker ps|grep some-container-name|sed \
      's/.*0.0.0.0://g'|sed 's/->.*//g')"

And, if you're using `docker-compose`, you can run, for example:

    PORT=$(docker-compose port web 80)

This will give you something like `0.0.0.0:32790`.
