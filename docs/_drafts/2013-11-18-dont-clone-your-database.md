One common model for Drupal development is maintaining development, staging and production environments, and managing code via git.

New features are moved _downstream_ from the development to the production environment using `hook_update_n()`s and config management (in Drupal 8) or Features (Drupal 7), combined with a written procedure to reproduce the desired behaviour on each environment.

In such a model, the production database is often cloned back _upstream_ to the development environment:
