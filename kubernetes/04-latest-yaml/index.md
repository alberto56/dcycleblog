Now, any time you want to get a local copy of the YAML file necessary to interact with your Kubernetes cluster (including now!), you can run [this script](https://github.com/dcycle/dcycle-kube-helper/blob/master/scripts/get-digitalocean-yaml-file.sh):

    export DOCLUSTERNAME=kubernetes-tutorial
    ./scripts/get-digitalocean-yaml-file.sh

All DigitalOcean Kubernetes clusters need a YAML file to interact when them, and we'll store these YAML files in the `$HOME/.kube` folder. Every week or so, these files will become outdated and no longer usable; all you need to do is rerun the above commands which will overwrite the old YAML file and replace it with a fresh one.

If you want to see what the YAML file looks like, you can run:

    cat "$HOME/.kube/kubernetes-helper-kubernetes-tutorial.yml"

And, again, you can manage several Kubernetes clusters by naming their YAML files accordingly.

**You now have a Kubernetes cluster on Digital Ocean, and you're ready to interact with it. Let's use it!**
